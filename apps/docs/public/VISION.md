# Vision & Scope

## Vision
Create a flexible, user-friendly, scalable LMS for CS learning. Organize around:
- **Courses → Assignments → Submissions → Feedback**, plus **Quizzes**.
- Multiple roles: **Learner, Instructor, Admin**.
- Unique submission: **Code Runner** (executes code in a sandbox with hidden tests) + optional **Video Walkthrough**.

## Goals
- Clear navigation from Login → Dashboard → Courses → Assignment → Submit/Quiz → Results.
- Great UX with a cohesive theme and high-contrast backgrounds.
- Deployed on Vercel; Next.js App Router; TypeScript; Tailwind.

## Non-Goals (Phase 1)
- Gradebook exports (CSV) beyond a simple summary.
- Custom LTI / SSO integrations (can be phase 2).
