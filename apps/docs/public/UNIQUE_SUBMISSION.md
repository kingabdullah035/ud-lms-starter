# Unique Submission Type: Code Runner + Video Walkthrough

## Code Runner
- Learners paste code or upload a file.
- API sends code to a runner endpoint that executes public + hidden tests.
- UI shows public results instantly; hidden tests affect final score.
- Prevents “copy-only” by verifying logic vs. test cases.

## Video Walkthrough (optional)
- Learner can attach a 30–90s video explaining their solution.
- Instructors can require the video for certain assignments.
- Helps evaluate understanding, not just code.

## Anti-copy note
- Code Runner + quick oral explanation raises originality while remaining student-friendly.
